# Coding Playground  

This repository serves as my **personal coding playground** throughout my year in **Information Technology**. Here, I practice programming concepts, experiment with different languages, and build small projects to sharpen my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.  

## Structure  
- Each folder is named after a **programming language**.  
- Inside each language folder are subfolders or files for exercises, challenges, and projects.  
- Some entries include notes or explanations for concepts I explored.  

## Purpose  
- Strengthen problem-solving through hands-on coding.  
- Explore syntax and features across different programming languages.  
- Document my progress and growth as a student in IT.  

## Tech Stack Practiced  
- **C** – Programming fundamentals and system-level concepts.
- **Java** – OOP, data structures, and algorithms.  
- **Python** – Scripting, problem-solving, and automation.

> This is not a polished project repo, but rather a **sandbox of growth**, documenting my coding journey as an IT student.
