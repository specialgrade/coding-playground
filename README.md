# 👩‍💻 Coding Challenge

This is a personal initiative where I commit to **at least one program every day** to improve my proficiency across various programming languages. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills, understand syntax differences, and explore language-specific features.

> **"Small daily improvements are the key to staggering long-term results." – James Clear**

## Structure
- Each folder is named after a **programming language**.

- Each entry contains a named program file and a brief explanation (if necessary).
